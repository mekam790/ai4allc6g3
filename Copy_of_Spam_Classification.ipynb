This was the ninth West Point class to graduate since hijackers smashed planes into New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Most of those commissioned on Saturday were 12 at the time.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bush addressed their predecessors, he had toppled the Taliban government in Afghanistan and was turning attention to Iraq. \\\"If we wait for threats to fully materialize,\\\" he said then, \\\"we will have waited too long.\\\" As Mr. Obama took the stage on a mild, overcast day, the American war in Iraq was winding down, but Afghanistan had flared out of control and terrorists were making a fresh effort to strike inside the United States.\\n\\n\\\"This war has changed over the last nine years, but it's no less important than it was in those days after 9/11,\\\" Mr. Obama said. Recalling his decision announced here six months ago to send 30,000 reinforcements to Afghanistan, Mr. Obama said difficult days were ahead, but added, \\\"I have no doubt that together with our Afghan and international partners, we will succeed in Afghanistan.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Obama all but declared victory in Iraq, praising the military, but not Mr. Bush, for turning it around. \\\"A lesser Army might have seen its spirit broken,\\\" he said. \\\"But the American military is more resilient than that.\\\"\\n\\nAt home, Mr. Obama attributed the failure of efforts to blow up an airplane over Detroit and a car packed with explosives in Times Square to the intense American pursuit of radical groups abroad. \\\"These failed attacks show that pressure on networks like Al Qaeda is forcing them to rely on terrorists with less time and space to train,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAnd he defended his revised counterterrorism policies that critics say have weakened America's defenses. \\\"We should not discard our freedoms because extremists try to exploit them,\\\" he said. \\\"We cannot succumb to division because others try to drive us apart.\\\"\\n\\nThe speech offered a glimpse of his first official national security strategy, to be released this week, including four principles: to build strength abroad by building strength at home through education, clean energy and innovation; to promote \\\"the renewed engagement of our diplomats\\\" and support international development; to rebuild alliances; and to promote human rights and democracy abroad.\\n\\nBut even as he tried to distinguish his strategy from Mr. Bush's, Mr. Obama faced the same daunting realization and expressed it with a line Mr. Bush used repeatedly: \\\"This is a different kind of war,\\\" he said. \\\"There will be no simple moment of surrender to mark the journey's end, no armistice or banner headline.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Virtuwell writes prescriptions in 12 states, but only to 18-to-34-year-olds because prescribing to women older than that can involve more complex health considerations. Lemonaid, available in seven states, insists that women 35 and older receive pills containing only progestin, since pills containing estrogen may increase heart risks for some women in that age group.\\n\\n\\\"We are being especially conservative by choice,\\\" said Dr. Jason Hwang, Lemonaid's chief medical officer. He said Lemonaid's minimum age is 18, \\\"not based on clinical grounds; it was a political decision. We didn't want people who might be under 18, who might still have parents who would get upset if we were making decisions for them.\\\"\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood, whose every move is scrutinized by anti-abortion activists, has also introduced an app, Planned Parenthood Care, which requires video visits with doctors or nurse practitioners. About two-thirds of the roughly 19,000 users to date were new to Planned Parenthood, said Jill Balderson, the organization's vice president of online health strategy. While users of nonvideo apps appreciate the anytime-anywhere aspect, she said some Planned Parenthood Care clients like video encounters because, beyond contraception, they want \\\"an in-depth consultation with an expert.\\\"\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood Care currently serves Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Washington State and also Alaska, where women in remote locations get the contraceptives delivered by float plane. But many live in urban areas, and Ms. Balderson said the most common place women conduct the video doctor's visits is \\\"their parked car\\\" during work lunch breaks. (Planned Parenthood Direct, a nonvideo version that sends prescriptions to women's pharmacies, recently began in California).\\n\\nSome experts committed to expanding contraceptive access, like Dr. Mark DeFrancesco of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, sounded a few cautionary notes. Dr. DeFrancesco, the immediate past president of the group, which endorses making contraceptives nonprescription, praised the services' convenience, but said he worried that women participating in the brief digital interactions with clinicians might think, \\\"Now, I don't have to go to a doctor\\\" at all.\\n\\nHe added that, since some services do not take insurance, customers may pay fees they would not incur if they had received a prescription during a doctor's appointment.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This was the ninth West Point class to graduate since hijackers smashed planes into New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. Most of those commissioned on Saturday were 12 at the time.\\n\\nWhen Mr. Bush addressed their predecessors, he had toppled the Taliban government in Afghanistan and was turning attention to Iraq. \\\"If we wait for threats to fully materialize,\\\" he said then, \\\"we will have waited too long.\\\" As Mr. Obama took the stage on a mild, overcast day, the American war in Iraq was winding down, but Afghanistan had flared out of control and terrorists were making a fresh effort to strike inside the United States.\\n\\n\\\"This war has changed over the last nine years, but it's no less important than it was in those days after 9/11,\\\" Mr. Obama said. Recalling his decision announced here six months ago to send 30,000 reinforcements to Afghanistan, Mr. Obama said difficult days were ahead, but added, \\\"I have no doubt that together with our Afghan and international partners, we will succeed in Afghanistan.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Obama all but declared victory in Iraq, praising the military, but not Mr. Bush, for turning it around. \\\"A lesser Army might have seen its spirit broken,\\\" he said. \\\"But the American military is more resilient than that.\\\"\\n\\nAt home, Mr. Obama attributed the failure of efforts to blow up an airplane over Detroit and a car packed with explosives in Times Square to the intense American pursuit of radical groups abroad. \\\"These failed attacks show that pressure on networks like Al Qaeda is forcing them to rely on terrorists with less time and space to train,\\\" he said.\\n\\nAnd he defended his revised counterterrorism policies that critics say have weakened America's defenses. \\\"We should not discard our freedoms because extremists try to exploit them,\\\" he said. \\\"We cannot succumb to division because others try to drive us apart.\\\"\\n\\nThe speech offered a glimpse of his first official national security strategy, to be released this week, including four principles: to build strength abroad by building strength at home through education, clean energy and innovation; to promote \\\"the renewed engagement of our diplomats\\\" and support international development; to rebuild alliances; and to promote human rights and democracy abroad.\\n\\nBut even as he tried to distinguish his strategy from Mr. Bush's, Mr. Obama faced the same daunting realization and expressed it with a line Mr. Bush used repeatedly: \\\"This is a different kind of war,\\\" he said. \\\"There will be no simple moment of surrender to mark the journey's end, no armistice or banner headline.\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Virtuwell writes prescriptions in 12 states, but only to 18-to-34-year-olds because prescribing to women older than that can involve more complex health considerations. Lemonaid, available in seven states, insists that women 35 and older receive pills containing only progestin, since pills containing estrogen may increase heart risks for some women in that age group.\\n\\n\\\"We are being especially conservative by choice,\\\" said Dr. Jason Hwang, Lemonaid's chief medical officer. He said Lemonaid's minimum age is 18, \\\"not based on clinical grounds; it was a political decision. We didn't want people who might be under 18, who might still have parents who would get upset if we were making decisions for them.\\\"\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood, whose every move is scrutinized by anti-abortion activists, has also introduced an app, Planned Parenthood Care, which requires video visits with doctors or nurse practitioners. About two-thirds of the roughly 19,000 users to date were new to Planned Parenthood, said Jill Balderson, the organization's vice president of online health strategy. While users of nonvideo apps appreciate the anytime-anywhere aspect, she said some Planned Parenthood Care clients like video encounters because, beyond contraception, they want \\\"an in-depth consultation with an expert.\\\"\\n\\nPlanned Parenthood Care currently serves Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Washington State and also Alaska, where women in remote locations get the contraceptives delivered by float plane. But many live in urban areas, and Ms. Balderson said the most common place women conduct the video doctor's visits is \\\"their parked car\\\" during work lunch breaks. (Planned Parenthood Direct, a nonvideo version that sends prescriptions to women's pharmacies, recently began in California).\\n\\nSome experts committed to expanding contraceptive access, like Dr. Mark DeFrancesco of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, sounded a few cautionary notes. Dr. DeFrancesco, the immediate past president of the group, which endorses making contraceptives nonprescription, praised the services' convenience, but said he worried that women participating in the brief digital interactions with clinicians might think, \\\"Now, I don't have to go to a doctor\\\" at all.\\n\\nHe added that, since some services do not take insurance, customers may pay fees they would not incur if they had received a prescription during a doctor's appointment.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n

    "The Logistic Regression model performed exceptionally well with an accuracy of 96.99%. The high precision and recall for the \"real\" class demonstrate that the model is very effective at correctly identifying real news articles. For the \"fale\" class, the model still shows strong performance, as reflected by the F1-score of 0.97. Overall, this model is highly reliable for fake detection in political news articles.\n"
